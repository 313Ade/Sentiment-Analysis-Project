# Sentiment-Analysis-Project


### Unofficial documentation <br>
This web app was developed as a final year project. I think it runs slower on Chrome, I haven't tested that yet. <br>
There are also areas for improvement like speed. Especially speed. It takes about a minute to process a thousand rows of data. <br> 
I don't know how similar apps compare in speed but I think it can be faster. <br>
Also it is about 215 lines long, there's an st.stop around there. Anything after that can be considered legacy code. Use it for references <br>
Finally, I haven't handled error handling. I don't know how the app would react when a user uploads a non-CSV file.
